TODO

Make BPTT work properly
It's possible x_next_grad isn't doing anything?
Note: Gradient decreases when dLdW_x and dLdb_ are set to 0, but dLdW_h is left on its own
Try gradient checking!
In check_sep_layer(), replace the multiple parameters with a layer

Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, Conjugate gradient descent?

Make it so dloss() can be a function of more than just h

Add a softmax layer for the output of the LSTM

Perform BPTT on LSTM using subsequences of size k

Implement regularization

Make it so you don't forward propagate in both backprop_once() and BPTT()
